        ABOUT ME

      <p class="large sub-title bold">
        Professionally
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer with a focus in Front End Web Development. At my previous job, I primarily worked on the consumer websites 4moms.com and global.4moms.com, as well as the eCommerce website shop.4moms.com, totalling 19 websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at 4moms, I played a significant role rebuilding all 19 sites to be responsive. This increased mobile traffic by 45% and mobile conversion rate by 25% within 6 weeks of completion of implementation.
        I also created a web application that automated documentation of product information coming off of the assembly line. This site functioned offline using application cache and local storage. 4moms went from capturing 0 to 15,000 product assemblies per month without a cost increase.

        Personally
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a detail oriented, truth telling, left-brain math enthusiast with just enough of right-brain creativity to balance out my technical skills for the perfect balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about putting in a good days work so that I can come home to my 3 year old puppy and play a fun game of tug a war or take a quick weekend trip to anywhere in the world. I enjoy volunteering and helping others as well as love learning about other cultures. Learn more about me:

        4moms Website
      </p>
      <p>
        While working at 4moms, I spent an extensive amount of time working on the company website where I touched almost every page. Once the design files are recieved, I work with the relevent designers to execute page updates with great attention to detail. A noteworthy project was a website wide responsive redesign. Some of the most interesting pages I updated (links added and verified through June 2016) are:

      <p>
        As an iSTEP intern during the summer of 2013, I implemented a website in about 12 hours to show case the internship program for the nonprofit TechBridgeWorld. This work was accomplished by collaborating with the design intern.

        In case you weren't sure, I created this website from scratch. This work highlights some of my CSS3 skills including transitions and transformations. I even created the basic design!

        User Interactive GIF

        This was a fun side project I did after being inspired by another website. Using JavaScript, I allowed potential users to interact with images by dragging either mouse on computer or finger on touch screen. Try it yourself below!
